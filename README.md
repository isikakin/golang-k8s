# Project Summary

I have been planning to share an article about Golang for a while. Then I decided that this should be a series of articles. I hope it will be an understandable and entertaining. I will share github repository in the last post. Have fun!

# What will we do?
First, we will see how to develop a web api using the Echo framework in the Golang world. Next, we will create two simple services, which we’ll call productapi and categoryapi. Then we’ll connect to MongoDB from our services and do CRUD operations. Also, we will generate api gateway using KrakenD in front of apps. Finally, we will run all applications on Kubernetes.

# Project Topics
- Golang simple REST API
